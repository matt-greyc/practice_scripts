# Exercise 23 - File Overlap  
# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.
# One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of
# happy numbers up to 1000. (Prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number.
# And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia.)

    content_file_2 = get_file_content(file_2) # content of the 2nd file, e.g. -> '3 4 5 6 7'

    # we split the content to get numbers
    nums_file_1 = content_file_1.split() # splits the content on whitespace -> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
    nums_file_2 = content_file_2.split() # splits the content on whitespace -> ['3', '4', '5', '6', '7']

    # now we convert lists of numbers into sets, duplicates are removed if they are present
